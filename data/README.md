## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdeepak/thermal-images-for-breast-cancer-diagnosis-dmrir/data?select=Imagens+e+Matrizes+da+Tese+de+Thiago+Alves+Elias+da+Silva).  
It contains **infrared thermal images** and **thermal matrices** used for breast cancer diagnosis, originally from the **doctoral thesis of Thiago Alves Elias da Silva**.


This dataset forms the basis for our project pipeline, where we extract relevant features, simulate heat flow using the **Pennes bioheat equation**, and train an AI model to classify breast tumors.
